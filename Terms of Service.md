If there is a conflict between these Terms and the mandatory Apple Standard EULA provisions for iOS app usage, Apple’s Standard EULA controls to the extent of that conflict.

Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to iOS app usage and may enforce those terms against you.

## 7) Third-Party Services

EasyAgent may rely on third-party services (for example, telephony, AI, analytics, notification, and billing providers). Availability and performance may depend on those services. We are not responsible for outages or changes caused by third-party platforms.

Your use of third-party services may be subject to those providers’ separate terms and policies.

## 8) Intellectual Property

The App, including software, branding, and content (excluding your own data), is owned by Drecom or its licensors and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. No ownership is transferred to you.

## 9) Your Data

You retain rights to data you submit, subject to the rights needed for us to operate the service. Our collection and handling of personal data are described in our Privacy Policy.

You represent that you have all rights, permissions, and legal bases required to upload, process, or communicate data through the service.

## 10) Disclaimers

To the maximum extent permitted by law, EasyAgent is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, non-infringement, or uninterrupted availability.

## 11) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Drecom is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business interruption arising from your use of the App.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the service will not exceed the greater of (a) amounts you paid us for the service during the 12 months before the claim, or (b) USD $50.

## 12) Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, pose security/legal risk, or misuse the service. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it and canceling subscriptions through your app store account.

Sections that by nature should survive termination (including ownership, disclaimers, limitations, indemnity, and dispute terms) will survive.

## 13) Indemnity

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Drecom and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the service, your content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 15) Governing Law

These Terms are governed by applicable laws of the jurisdiction where Drecom is established, excluding conflict-of-law rules, unless mandatory consumer law in your jurisdiction requires otherwise.

## 16) Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after updates become effective means you accept the revised Terms.
